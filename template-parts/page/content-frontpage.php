          <p class="text">
            Advicer has two types of question models for individuals. You can learn what you are curious about by asking draft or private questions to the friends of the person you want to have information about. Moreover, both the person asking the question and the person answering will remain completely anonymous and will not be visible to anyone. You can ask questions about anyone, whether they are your friend or not. Additionally, you can share on your own page and ask people to answer your questions. When you add tags related to your questions, people experienced in that subject can view and answer your questions. In general sharing questions, the person asking and the person answering will be visible to everyone. Donâ€™t forget to reward helpful answers by liking or rating them ðŸ™‚

          <p class="text">
            These are prepared ready-made questions by the Advicer team under five main topic headings. These topic headings are Love, Family, Friendship, Work, and Trust. The question you ask will be sent to the personâ€™s friends. Each of their friends selects one answer option. Within 24 hours at the latest, you will receive a report on that question. The report will only display percentages. The identities of the respondents and their answers will not be visible.

Your custom question will be sent to the person without revealing your identity, and their approval will be obtained. If the person approves, the question will be sent to their friends, answered, and you will receive a notification. If the person does not approve, you will receive a notification stating that the question was not approved. In this question model as well, the asker and the respondents remain completely anonymous. The parties cannot see each other.
